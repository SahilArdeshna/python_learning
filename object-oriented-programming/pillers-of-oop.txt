1) Encapsulation
-> Encapsulation is the binding of data and functions that manipulate that data.

2) Abstraction
-> Abstraction means hiding of information or abstracting away information and giving access to only what's 
   necessary.

3) Inheritance
-> Inheritance allows new objects to take on the properties of existing objects. So you can inherit classes.

4) Polymorphism
-> Poly means many and morphism means form, so "many forms".
-> Now in Python, this idea of polymorphism refers to the way in which object classes can share the same 
   method name. But those method names can act differently based on what object calls them.
