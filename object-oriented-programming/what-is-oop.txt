1) what is object oriented programming(OOP)?
-> OOP is a programming paradigm, or a specific way of designing a program. It allows us to think of the data in our program 
   in terms of real-world objects, with both properties and behaviors. These objects can be passed around throughout our program.

-> Properties define the state of the object. This is the data that the object stores. This data can be a built-in type like 
   int, or even our own custom types weâ€™ll create later.

-> Behaviors are the actions our object can take. Oftentimes, this involves using or modifying the properties of our object.

-> Object oriented programming(OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviours into
   individual objects.
